Instructions for setting up the development environment
=======================================================

Short version:

   1. Arduino IDE -> http://www.arduino.org/software
   2. Android SDK -> http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
     2.1. ./tools/android -> SDK Built-tools 23.0.2
                             Android 5.1.1 (22)
			     Android Support Library
			     Google Repository
   3. JDK 1.8     -> http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Long version:

1. Install Arduino IDE

Go to:

   http://www.arduino.org/software

and install the correct version for your OS.

Hopefully the build system will find it automatically (detection is performed
at the top of arduino/arduino.gradle). If you have installed it somewhere else,
just point arduinoDir in arduino/gradle.properties to your installation.

2. Install Android SDK

Go to:

   http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

install the correct SDK for your OS. Make sure ANDROID_HOME points to the SDK.

Start Android SDK Manager (android in tools directory) and install at least:

   * Android SDK Build-tools 23.0.2
   * Android 5.1.1 API (22)
   * Android Support Library
   * Google Repository

3. Install JDK 1.8

Go to:

   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

and install the correct JDK for your OS. At least 1.8 is needed. Nothing more
should have to be done.

4. Build code

Try to build everything from repository roo with:

   ./gradlew build

Everything should build.
